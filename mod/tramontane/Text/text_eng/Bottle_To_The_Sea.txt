This pearl is so dense with data it almost reached capacity,<LINE>I'm not sure I can read it in its entirety before the rain comes...<LINE>The weather here became so much more chaotic, I hope Five Pebbles' predicament hasn't gotten worse.
...Sorry, I just worry a lot about him.
Let's read it, I can at least try to summarize its contents.<LINE>...
...Oh...
This is a repository put together by multiple iterators.<LINE>There's a bit of everything, from studies on ascension and astronomy reports to pictures of plants and wildlife...<LINE>There's even conversation logs.
It seems to have been added onto over time as the pearl travelled with you, some recorded who you visited.
Five Pebbles recently added some historical documents from his archives as well as his own studies.<LINE>It's a relief he's still here, but at that point I'm not sure for how long...
...Hold on. There's a short message in there.
"If the contents of this pearl do not make it to the hands of whichever sapient creature will come after us (if any),<LINE>may it bring comfort to whoever it reaches. May it keep company to those who, like me, are losing or lost their communication lines."
Signed by Distant Memories. I don't recall even hearing about them, to be honest.<LINE>But it's bittersweet that despite everyone's systems slowly eroding to time, some still try to reach out to others.
I unfortunately cannot keep that, this place is not sheltered from the rain,<LINE>and it would be such a loss to let this pearl fade.
But thank you for bringing it to me anyway.
